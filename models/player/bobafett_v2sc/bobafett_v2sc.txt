Knows bugs:
Top of jet pack goes though his head in some animations. Not much I can do about it. No chrome texture. If anyone knows how to do this, let me know and I'll add it. Multiplayer BMP thinks it has team colors and doesn't display correctly.

Description:
Here is one less model on the Cold Fusion Wish List (http://www.planethalflife.com/coldfusion/)! After more that 30 hours of modeling and texturing it's finaly done. Each and every polygon hand-built by me, except for the arms, which belong to the gordon model. I saw no reason to remodel something that was already made. All textures made to match the latest version of Boba Fett. The modifier stack in 3DSMAX had at least 40 modifiers and froze my computer numerous time. It's a little bit bulky at 700 polygons, but I can't do it with much less and still have all of the details that I want. I hope that everyone likes it. Please send me any comments or suggestions you may have.

If there is something wronge with the design or model, then let me know so that I can fix it in an upcoming release.

I'm also taking requests or suggestions for models.

Remember, this model is Copyrighted by me, Doug Hillyer. If you want to use this model or need one custom built for a MOD, then contact me.

Enjoy!

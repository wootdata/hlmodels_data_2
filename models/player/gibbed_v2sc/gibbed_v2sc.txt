Gibbed player skin for Half-Life
=======================
Gibbed is my first attempt at a player skin for Half-Life, based on the Gordon model.  He's had a rough day, but Gibby's not down for the count yet!  He sports nicely exposed glistening organs and patches of more-or-less intact skin over much larger stretches of exposed muscle and general gore.
 
I was inspired by the fine "Sheet o' Carnage" texture map from Q3, and parts of it went into making Gibbed.

To use, extract gibbed.mdl and gibbed.bmp to Half-Life\valve\models\player\gibbed.

--- DEMO, MAP, or MODEL Additional Info------------------------

This Model is based on an agent from the movie 'The Matrix' which
is my favourite film. it is based on the Gman model with an edited
skin, we made the face darker, changed the suit to be black and white
and made the whole tie - instead of the pin, able to change colour.
In addition we put sunglasses and an earpiece on him.

You may only use this skin for private use only, you may distribute
it on any form to other people for free. if there is a charge involved
(i.e. put on a C.D) please contact me and we can arrange something.
You may not use this skin as a clan skin either, as it is DEFCON 1's
clan skin. That doesn't stop you from using this skin as a base to build
other skins on, as long as you tell me and give me credit.

Character Info:
Psycho Steve, as dubbed by his peers, is a mild-mannered 17 year old coffee addict.  He is my original creation, used as my MercWorks mascot and who starred in his own now-dead mod.  Although he was released once before, he was my first model ever and therefore quite unrefined, so I am rereleasing him now as a completely new model.

Other Stuff:
Also included in this zip are three spray logos: the MercWorks logo (mercworkslogo.bmp), the Psycho Steve logo (stevelogo.bmp), and the Eugene the crazed hippie logo (eugenelogo.bmp).  Place these in your Half-Life/logos directory for use in-game.

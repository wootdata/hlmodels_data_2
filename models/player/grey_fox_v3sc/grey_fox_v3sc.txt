So, I think you get the point, I made it all myself :p.

I don't mind if you edit my model and skin, just make sure you give
me credit for the original model and skin. 

----------------------------------------------

Installation:

Just drop which version(s) you want into your ts models folder 

 (C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\*your username*\half-life\ts\models\player)

Then select the model from the customize menu in the TS main menu and click apply.

To use the katana, drop the p_katana.mdl file directly into the models folder, you may want
to backup your current katana, just incase you want to go back to it.
----------------------------------------------

Well, thats it, hope you enjoy it, I worked my ass of on this pack and really hope you like it.
